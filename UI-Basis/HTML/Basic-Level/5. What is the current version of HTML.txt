5. What is the current version of HTML?
-----------------------------------------------
The current version of HTML is HTML5. While HTML itself doesn't follow a strict versioning system after HTML5, various improvements 
and new features continue to be introduced as part of the HTML5 specification.

HTML Living Standard, maintained by the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group), is now the ongoing standard. 
This means that HTML is continuously updated and improved with new features, but without distinct version numbers like "HTML6." 
The Living Standard approach ensures that web developers always have access to the latest features and best practices.

For practical purposes, HTML5 is still considered the current version, with ongoing incremental updates to the specification.
