problem before html
    - there is no proper universal structure of the web content across the systems, browsers, devices, and there is no www(worl wide web) rules
        * html can solve this problem by providing www rules as part of basic building blocks like html, css.
    - there no inter connectivity among the different content / pages?
        * html can solve this problem using hyper links (<a src="http://test.com" />)
    - there was a gap to retrieve or access the documents among the different servers?
        * by creating html like documents we can retrieve/access them as easy as possible by hyperlinks
    - there was no dynamic interactivity or dynamic behaviour change to the static content
        * using html we can make web page more dynamic to its behavioural change and interactivity using other technologies like CSS, JS.
