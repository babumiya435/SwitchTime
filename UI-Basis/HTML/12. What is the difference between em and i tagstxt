12. What is the difference between <em> and <i> tags?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The `<em>` and `<i>` tags in HTML both render text in italics, but they have different purposes and semantic meanings. Hereâ€™s a detailed 
comparison:

### **`<i>` Tag**

- **Purpose:** The `<i>` tag is used to apply italic styling to text. It does not convey any special emphasis or meaning beyond its 
visual representation.
- **Usage:** Primarily used for styling text to appear in italics without implying any additional context or emphasis.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p>This is <i>italic text</i> using the i tag.</p>
  ```

### **`<em>` Tag**

- **Purpose:** The `<em>` tag is used to indicate that the text should be emphasized. This tag conveys a semantic meaning that the text 
is of importance or should be stressed.
- **Usage:** Used to give text emphasis, suggesting that the content is significant or carries extra weight. Browsers typically render it 
as italicized text.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p>This is <em>important text</em> using the em tag.</p>
  ```

### **Differences**

1. **Semantic Meaning:**
   - **`<i>`:** No semantic meaning; it is used purely for visual styling.
   - **`<em>`:** Carries semantic meaning; it indicates that the enclosed text should be emphasized or stressed, implying that it is 
   important in context.

2. **Accessibility:**
   - **`<i>`:** Provides no additional context to assistive technologies; it only changes the text appearance.
   - **`<em>`:** Provides context to assistive technologies by signaling that the text is emphasized, which can be useful for screen 
   readers and other accessibility tools.

3. **Styling:**
   - Both tags render text in italics by default. However, `<em>` is used when the text needs to be emphasized with semantic meaning, 
   while `<i>` is used for visual styling without implying importance.

### **Example in Context**

#### Using `<i>` for Styling
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example with <i> Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Here is some <i>italicized text</i> with no additional emphasis.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Using `<em>` for Emphasis
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example with <em> Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Make sure to read this <em>important note</em> for additional information.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Summary**

- **`<i>`**: Use for visual styling to make text italicized without implying any special meaning or emphasis.
- **`<em>`**: Use to emphasize text, indicating that it should be stressed or is important in the context, which also helps with 
accessibility and semantic meaning.

In modern web development, it's recommended to use `<em>` for emphasizing important content and `<i>` for stylistic italic text that 
does not carry additional meaning.
