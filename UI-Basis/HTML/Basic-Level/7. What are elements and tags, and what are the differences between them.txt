7. What are elements and tags, and what are the differences between them?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In HTML, **elements** and **tags** are fundamental concepts used to define and structure web content. Here’s a detailed explanation of 
each and their differences:

### **Tags**

- **Definition:** Tags are the markup used to define elements in HTML. They are written in angle brackets and usually come in pairs: 
an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags specify the beginning and end of an HTML element.
  
- **Syntax:**
  - **Opening Tag:** `<tagname>`
  - **Closing Tag:** `</tagname>`

- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```
  - `<p>` is the opening tag.
  - `</p>` is the closing tag.

### **Elements**

- **Definition:** Elements are the fundamental building blocks of an HTML document. An element is composed of an opening tag, content, 
and a closing tag. In some cases, elements can be self-closing, meaning they do not have separate closing tags.

- **Syntax:**
  - **Start Tag:** `<tagname>`
  - **Content:** The text or other HTML elements nested inside.
  - **End Tag:** `</tagname>`

- **Self-Closing Elements:** Some elements do not have a closing tag and are self-contained. In HTML5, self-closing elements are written 
with just a start tag, e.g., `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`.

- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```
  - **Element:** `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`
    - **Start Tag:** `<p>`
    - **Content:** `This is a paragraph.`
    - **End Tag:** `</p>`

### **Differences Between Elements and Tags**

1. **Scope:**
   - **Tags:** Refer specifically to the markup used to define the boundaries of an element.
   - **Elements:** Encompass the entire construct, including the opening tag, content, and closing tag.

2. **Usage:**
   - **Tags:** Used in the syntax of HTML to create elements. They are the building blocks of elements.
   - **Elements:** Are used to structure content on a web page. They are what tags create and describe.

3. **Self-Closing Tags:**
   - **Tags:** Some HTML tags can be self-closing and do not require a closing tag, such as `<img>` and `<br>`.
   - **Elements:** Even self-closing elements are considered complete entities, even if they don’t have a closing tag.

### **Examples**

**Element with Opening and Closing Tags:**
```html
<div class="container">
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Paragraph content.</p>
</div>
```
- **Element:** `<div class="container"> ... </div>`
  - **Opening Tag:** `<div class="container">`
  - **Content:** `<h1>Title</h1> <p>Paragraph content.</p>`
  - **Closing Tag:** `</div>`

**Self-Closing Element:**
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo">
```
- **Element:** `<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo">`
  - **Start Tag:** `<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo">` (Note: No separate closing tag)

In summary, **tags** are the components of HTML syntax that create elements, while **elements** are the complete structures formed by these tags and their content.
