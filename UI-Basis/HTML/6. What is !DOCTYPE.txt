`<!DOCTYPE>` (Document Type Declaration) is an instruction that tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in. 
It helps the browser interpret and render the content of the document correctly. In modern HTML (HTML5), the `<!DOCTYPE>` 
declaration is required to ensure the page is rendered in **standards mode** rather than **quirks mode**.

### Syntax
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is placed at the very top of an HTML document, before the `<html>` tag. It is not case-sensitive, 
though it's commonly written in uppercase.

### HTML5 Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example HTML5 Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML5!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Points:
- **No Version Number:** In HTML5, the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is simply `<!DOCTYPE html>`, without specifying any version or DTD 
(Document Type Definition), as it did in previous HTML versions.
- **Standards Mode vs Quirks Mode:** Without the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, browsers may enter quirks mode, where they emulate behavior 
for older, non-standard websites. In **standards mode**, browsers follow modern web standards to render the page.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Older versions of HTML, like HTML 4.01 or XHTML, had more complex `<!DOCTYPE>` declarations that referenced
specific DTDs. In contrast, HTML5â€™s declaration is much simpler and more developer-friendly.

### Example of a Complex DOCTYPE in HTML 4.01:
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

In summary, `<!DOCTYPE>` is essential for making sure the browser interprets the HTML code according to modern standards.
