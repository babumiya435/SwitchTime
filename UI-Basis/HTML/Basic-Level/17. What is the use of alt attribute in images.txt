17. What is the use of alt attribute in images?
-----------------------------------------------

The `alt` attribute (short for "alternative text") in the `<img>` tag is used to provide a textual description of an image. 
This attribute serves several important purposes:

### **1. Accessibility**

- **Purpose:** The `alt` attribute helps improve accessibility for users who rely on screen readers. Screen readers read out the `alt` 
text to describe the image to visually impaired users, providing context and information that they might not otherwise have.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
  ```
  - Here, a screen reader would read "Company Logo" to describe the image of the logo.

### **2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**

- **Purpose:** Search engines use the `alt` text to understand the content of an image, which can help improve the page's SEO. Including 
relevant keywords in the `alt` text can contribute to better search engine rankings.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <img src="sunset.jpg" alt="Beautiful sunset over the mountains">
  ```
  - This description helps search engines understand what the image is about, potentially improving the pageâ€™s relevance for related 
  search queries.

### **3. Content Preservation**

- **Purpose:** If an image fails to load due to a broken link or slow network, the `alt` text is displayed in place of the image. 
This ensures that users still receive some information about the image.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <img src="product.jpg" alt="Product image showing a sleek modern design">
  ```
  - If "product.jpg" cannot be loaded, the text "Product image showing a sleek modern design" will be displayed instead.

### **Best Practices for Writing `alt` Text**

1. **Be Descriptive:** Provide a clear and concise description of the image content.
   - **Example:** `<img src="dog.jpg" alt="Golden retriever playing with a ball in the park">`

2. **Avoid Redundancy:** Do not use phrases like "image of" or "picture of" unless necessary. The context of the `alt` attribute already 
indicates that it's describing an image.
   - **Example:** `<img src="cake.jpg" alt="Chocolate birthday cake with candles">`

3. **Keep It Short:** Aim for a brief description that conveys the essential information. However, for complex images, provide enough 
detail to convey the context.
   - **Example:** `<img src="map.jpg" alt="Map showing hiking trails in Yosemite National Park">`

4. **Use Empty `alt` for Decorative Images:** If an image is purely decorative and does not convey meaningful content, use an empty `alt` 
attribute (`alt=""`) to ensure screen readers ignore it.
   - **Example:** `<img src="decorative-border.png" alt="">`

### **Summary**

The `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag provides a textual description of an image, enhancing accessibility for screen readers, 
contributing to SEO, and ensuring content is still accessible if the image fails to load. It should be descriptive, concise, and used 
thoughtfully to improve user experience and content discoverability.
