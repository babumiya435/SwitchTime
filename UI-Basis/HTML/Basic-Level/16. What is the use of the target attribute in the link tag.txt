16. What is the use of the target attribute in the <link> tag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The `target` attribute is not typically used with the `<link>` tag in HTML. The `<link>` tag is used to define relationships between 
the current document and external resources, such as linking to stylesheets, favicons, or prefetching resources. 

### **Common Uses of the `<link>` Tag**

1. **Linking to Stylesheets**
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Links an external CSS file to the HTML document for styling.

2. **Specifying a Favicon**
   ```html
   <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Links to the favicon for the website, which appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

3. **Preloading Resources**
   ```html
   <link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous">
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Instructs the browser to preload a resource to improve performance.

### **Attributes of the `<link>` Tag**

- **`rel`**: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource.
- **`href`**: Defines the URL of the linked resource.
- **`type`**: Specifies the MIME type of the linked resource (e.g., `text/css` for stylesheets).
- **`media`**: Specifies the media type for which the linked resource is intended (e.g., `print`, `screen`).
- **`sizes`**: Used for specifying the size of icons in certain link types (e.g., `<link rel="icon" sizes="32x32" href="icon.png">`).
- **`crossorigin`**: Specifies whether to include credentials when fetching the resource (e.g., `anonymous`).

### **`target` Attribute in HTML**

The `target` attribute is used with the `<a>` (anchor) tag to specify where to open a linked document. Its values are:

- `_blank`: Opens the link in a new tab or window.
- `_self`: Opens the link in the same frame (default behavior).
- `_parent`: Opens the link in the parent frame.
- `_top`: Opens the link in the full window.

### **Summary**

The `target` attribute does not apply to the `<link>` tag. Instead, it is used with the `<a>` tag to control where the linked document 
opens. The `<link>` tag is used for linking external resources like stylesheets and favicons, and it does not have a `target` attribute.
