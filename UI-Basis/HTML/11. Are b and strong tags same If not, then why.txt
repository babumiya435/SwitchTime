11. Are <b> and <strong> tags same? If not, then why?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The `<b>` and `<strong>` tags in HTML both render text in bold, but they have different purposes and semantic meanings. 
Here’s a detailed comparison:

### **`<b>` Tag**

- **Purpose:** The `<b>` tag is used to apply a bold styling to text. It does not convey any special importance or emphasis to the text; 
it is purely presentational.
- **Usage:** Primarily used for styling text without implying any additional meaning.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p>This is <b>bold text</b> using the b tag.</p>
  ```

### **`<strong>` Tag**

- **Purpose:** The `<strong>` tag is used to indicate that the text is of strong importance or emphasis. It not only makes the text bold 
but also suggests that the text has a semantic meaning or priority.
- **Usage:** Used to convey emphasis or importance in the text, and browsers will typically render it as bold.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p>This is <strong>important text</strong> using the strong tag.</p>
  ```

### **Differences**

1. **Semantic Meaning:**
   - **`<b>`:** No semantic meaning; it is used purely for visual presentation.
   - **`<strong>`:** Has semantic meaning; it indicates that the enclosed text is of strong importance or should be emphasized.

2. **Accessibility:**
   - **`<b>`:** Does not provide any additional context to assistive technologies. Screen readers will only see the text as bold.
   - **`<strong>`:** Provides context to assistive technologies by signaling that the text has strong importance, which can be useful for 
   screen readers and other accessibility tools.

3. **Styling:**
   - Both tags render text as bold by default, but `<strong>` implies a deeper level of emphasis than `<b>`, which is purely stylistic.

### **Example in Context**

#### Using `<b>` for Styling
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example with <b> Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Check out this <b>bold text</b> for emphasis.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Using `<strong>` for Emphasis
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example with <strong> Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Pay attention to this <strong>important text</strong> for crucial information.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Summary**

- **`<b>`**: Use for purely stylistic bold text.
- **`<strong>`**: Use to indicate that the text has strong importance or emphasis, providing semantic meaning and enhancing accessibility.

In modern web development, it’s recommended to use `<strong>` for emphasizing important content and `<b>` only when you need to apply 
bold styling without adding semantic meaning.
