13. How are comments added in HTML?
---------------------------------------

In HTML, comments are used to add notes or explanations within the code that are not visible in the browser. Comments can help make the 
code more readable and maintainable. They are ignored by the web browser and do not affect the rendering of the web page.

### **Syntax for HTML Comments**

- **Format:** `<!-- comment here -->`
- **Placement:** Comments can be placed anywhere in the HTML document, including within tags, outside of tags, or between elements.

### **Examples**

#### 1. **Simple Comment**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>HTML Comment Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- This is a comment. It will not appear in the browser. -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. **Commenting Out Code**

You can use comments to temporarily disable a part of the HTML code without deleting it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Commenting Out Code</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- <p>This paragraph is commented out and will not be displayed.</p> -->

    <p>This paragraph is visible.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

#### 3. **Multi-line Comments**

Comments can span multiple lines:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Multi-line Comment Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!--
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines.
        It will not be visible in the browser.
    -->

    <p>This is another visible paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### **Best Practices**

1. **Clarity:** Use comments to clarify complex sections of code, provide context, or explain the purpose of certain elements.
2. **Avoid Overuse:** While comments are useful, overusing them can clutter your code. Use them judiciously to keep the code clean and 
readable.
3. **Avoid Sensitive Information:** Do not include sensitive information or passwords in comments as they are visible in the HTML source 
code.

### **Summary**

HTML comments are added using `<!-- comment -->` syntax. They are useful for adding notes and explanations to the code and for 
temporarily disabling code without deleting it. Comments improve code readability and maintenance but should be used wisely to avoid 
cluttering the codebase.
