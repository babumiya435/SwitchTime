2. Difference between HTML and XHTML
-----------------------------------------------
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) are both markup languages used to structure web content.
However, there are key differences between them, mainly in terms of syntax, rules, and adherence to XML standards.
-----------------------------------------------
what are the Differences between HTML and XHTML with code exmples?
    - 1. Syntax Rules: html(tags are not case sensitive), xHtml(tags are case sensitive, syntax to follow xml rules, more stricter than html, DOCTYPE is must)
        
    - 2. Case Sensitivity:
        - html (<INPUT type=text /> or <input type=text /> are ok), xHtml(<input type = "text" />)
    - 3. Closing Tags:
        html(<input type=text > or <input type=text / are ok>), xHtml(<input type = "text" />)
    - 4. Attribute Quoting;
        - html(<input type=text /> or <input type="text" /> are ok), xHtml(<input type = "text" />)
    - 5. Attribute Minimization:
        - html(<input checked /> or <input checked = "checked" /> are ok), xHTML(<input checked = "checked" />)
    - 6. Document Type Declaration (Doctype):
        - <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> for "xhtml"
        - <!DOCTYPE html> - for "html5"
    - 7. Error Handling:
        - HTML browsers are forgiving of errors and will attempt to render the page even if the markup contains mistakes
        (chrome browser, and others may treat such errors differently hence we expect the stricter rules like xHtml).
        - XHTML browsers will stop rendering the page if they encounter syntax errors, due to strict XML rules.
